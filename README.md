# Personal Info Cleaning List

Inspired by a [blog series](https://little418.com/2017/05/personal-info-spring-cleaning-passwords.html) I did last year, this is a living list of places that publicly post your data.  Go through the list every once in awhile to make sure you understand what you're sharing with the world.
